Integration: RESTful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication
Update Frequency: Real-time streaming capabilities
Meta Graph API (Facebook/Instagram)
Purpose: Social media advertising data collection
Data Types:

Ad performance metrics
Audience engagement data
Attribution analytics

Integration: Graph API v18+ with webhook subscriptions
Rate Limiting: Handles API rate limits with exponential backoff
HubSpot API
Purpose: CRM and marketing automation data
Data Types:

CRM customer data
Email marketing metrics
Lead scoring and attribution

Integration: REST API with private app authentication
Sync Pattern: Incremental updates with change tracking
Social Listening Tools
Purpose: Brand monitoring and sentiment analysis
Data Types:

Brand mentions across platforms

2. Extraction and Orchestration Layer
Apache Airflow (Workflow Orchestration)
Purpose: Data pipeline orchestration and scheduling
Key Features:

DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) management
Scheduled ETL job execution
Error handling and retry mechanisms
Dependency management between tasks

Deployment: Cloud Composer on Google Cloud Platform
Monitoring: Built-in web UI with task status tracking
Data Pipeline Process

API Authentication and Rate Limiting: Manages OAuth tokens and API quotas
Data Extraction and Validation: Pulls data with schema validation
Transformation and Normalization: Standardizes data formats and applies business rules

3. Data Warehouse Layer
BigQuery (Cloud Data Warehouse)
Purpose: Centralized data storage and analytics processing
Architecture:

Petabyte-scale analytics with serverless infrastructure
Real-time data streaming capabilities
SQL-based querying with standard SQL syntax
Automated data partitioning for performance optimization

Dimensional Data Model
Fact Tables:

campaign_performance_daily - Daily aggregated campaign metrics
user_engagement_events - Individual user interaction events
conversion_attribution - Attribution modeling data
social_sentiment_scores - Sentiment analysis results

Dimension Tables:

dim_user - User demographics, segments, and lifetime value
dim_time - Date hierarchy with business calendar mapping
dim_customer - Customer acquisition channel and cohort data
dim_campaign - Campaign metadata, platform, and objectives
dim_geography - Regional, market, and timezone dimensions

Data Model Features

Star Schema Design: Optimized for analytical queries
SCD Type 2: Historical tracking for slowly changing dimensions
Automated Partitioning: Date-based partitioning for query performance
Columnar Storage: Compressed storage with efficient query patterns

4. Analytics and Visualization Layer
Looker Studio (Business Intelligence)
Purpose: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization
Features:

Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
Real-time data refresh from BigQuery
Custom calculated fields and metrics
Automated report generation and distribution

Dashboard Categories

Executive Summary Views: High-level KPI tracking
Campaign Performance Deep Dive: Detailed campaign analytics
Customer Journey Analysis: Multi-touch attribution modeling
ROI and Attribution Reports: Revenue impact analysis

5. Insights and Actions Layer
ML Insights (Predictive Analytics)
Purpose: AI-powered marketing optimization and forecasting
Capabilities:

Anomaly detection for campaign performance
Forecasting models for budget planning
Optimization recommendations for campaign targeting
Predictive customer lifetime value modeling

Automated Actions

Alert Notifications: Real-time performance monitoring
Budget Optimization: Automated budget reallocation
Performance Reports: Scheduled stakeholder updates
Campaign Recommendations: ML-driven optimization suggestions
